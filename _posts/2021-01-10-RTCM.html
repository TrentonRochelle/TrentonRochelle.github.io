<h2>Background</h2>
<br>
<h3>To minimize mortality of traumatically injured persons, coagulopathy must be assessed and addressed nearest to the time of injury. Coagulopathy of trauma is a hypo-coagulable state with increased bleeding and a 4x increased rate of mortality. </h3>
<h3>Our project involved improving a handheld device that will be sold to and used by medical professionals in the field for detecting the levels of coagulation in the blood of trauma patients. 
    To determine the systemic level of blood coagulation, electrochemical analysis is performed on a small chip containing the patientâ€™s blood sample after the chip is inserted into the device. 
    Predictable sample temperature is necessary to achieve an accurate measurement. 
    The alpha prototype device had no temperature control mechanisms, no external charging mechanism, and is not spatially optimized.</h3>

</p>

<h2>Parts Chosen</h2>
<br>
<h3>Android Phone</h3>
<p>
    Any Android smartphone with USB OTG is compatible with our system. OTG is required to maintain UART comminication with the microcontroller due to the dynamic usb host/slave configuration with charging
</p>

<h3>Microcontroller</h3>
<p>
    We were limited to the design of the previous alpha prototype which used the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMD21G18">SAMD21 Cortex-M0+ 32-bit low power ARM MCU</a> . This processor is used in the Arduino MKRZERO which allowed easy prototyping and vast open-source libraries
</p>

<h3>Potentiostat</h3>
<p>
    This element provides the ability to perform electrochemical measurements. For this we used the highly compact Emstat Pico by PalmSens.
</p>

<h3>Power System</h3>
<p>
    The Android phone supplied power to itself and we used a 1S 2500mAh LiPo battery to supply power to the rest of the electronics. Charging both the Android phone and the LiPo while maintaining power was made available through a modified Adafruit PowerBoost 1000C.
</p>

<h3>Temperature Reading</h3>
<p>
    A thin-film surface mounted thermistor (PT100) feeding into a MAX31865 digital amplifier was used to read the temperature on a rapidly changing basis. A PT100 was used due to it's low thermal mass, small size, and responsive thermal equilibrium.
</p>

<h3>Temperature Control</h3>
<p>
    The blood within the chip is heated or cooled by a Peltier Module where one side draws heat from the other side, where heat polarity is determined by current polarity. This can be controlled through an H-Bridge IC, polarity signal, and a PWM to determine power output.
</p>

<h3>Temperature Control Algorithm</h3>
<p>
    We used a software PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) to adjust the PWM which controlled the H-Bridge IC power output. 
    A PID is a control loop mechanism which employs feedback by continuously calculating an error value e(t) as the difference between a desired setpoint y(t) and a measured process variable r(t).
    The feedback is a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms, each multiplied by a respective weighting.
    This control is shown below:
